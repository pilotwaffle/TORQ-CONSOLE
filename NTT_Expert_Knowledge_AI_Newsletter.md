## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NTT Corporation has unveiled a groundbreaking Expert Knowledge Visualization AI technology that achieves approximately 90% accuracy in visualizing expert decision-making processes from dialogue data. This pioneering system addresses one of the most challenging problems in organizational knowledge management: capturing and transferring the implicit knowledge and reasoning patterns of expert professionals to less experienced staff.

The technology represents a significant breakthrough in making tacit expert knowledge explicit and actionable, particularly in critical domains such as security incident response and call center operations where expert decision-making has traditionally been difficult to codify and transfer. By extracting and formalizing the unique thought patterns of experts, this AI system enables organizations to scale expert-level performance across their workforce while building a foundation for automated, expert-grounded AI systems.

This innovation arrives at a crucial time when organizations worldwide face acute skills shortages and increasing operational complexity, making the democratization of expert knowledge a strategic imperative for maintaining competitive advantage and operational excellence.

## TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

NTT's Expert Knowledge Visualization AI represents a sophisticated approach to knowledge extraction and formalization that goes beyond traditional rule-based systems or simple data mining techniques. The technology employs advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze dialogue data and extract the underlying decision-making frameworks that experts use in their daily operations.

**Core Technology Architecture:**

The system operates through multiple integrated layers that work together to capture, analyze, and visualize expert reasoning:

1. **Dialogue Analysis Engine**: Processes conversational data from expert interactions, identifying key decision points, reasoning chains, and knowledge application patterns.

2. **Knowledge Extraction Framework**: Utilizes sophisticated NLP algorithms to identify and categorize the types of knowledge being applied, including factual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and contextual reasoning patterns.

3. **Decision Tree Visualization**: Creates interactive, visual representations of expert decision-making processes that can be easily understood and followed by non-experts.

4. **Pattern Recognition System**: Identifies recurring decision patterns and creates reusable knowledge templates that can be applied across similar scenarios.

The technology's 90% accuracy rate in capturing expert reasoning represents a significant achievement in the field of knowledge management AI. This high accuracy is achieved through the system's ability to not just identify what decisions experts make, but to understand and visualize the reasoning process behind those decisions.

**Integration with Broader AI Ecosystem:**

The Expert Knowledge Visualization AI is part of NTT's comprehensive approach to AI-driven transformation, which includes conversational AI tools built on platforms like Microsoft Fabric and Azure AI Agent Service. This integration enables seamless deployment across enterprise environments and ensures compatibility with existing AI infrastructure investments.

## KEY FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES

**Precision Knowledge Capture**: The system's ability to achieve 90% accuracy in visualizing expert decision-making processes sets it apart from traditional knowledge management solutions. This precision ensures that critical nuances in expert reasoning are preserved and made available for training and automation purposes.

**Real-Time Processing**: The technology can analyze ongoing conversations and interactions to continuously update and refine its understanding of expert knowledge, creating a dynamic and evolving knowledge base that improves over time.

**Multi-Modal Knowledge Representation**: Beyond simple text-based outputs, the system creates visual decision trees, flowcharts, and interactive guides that make expert knowledge accessible to users with different learning preferences and technical backgrounds.

**Scalable Knowledge Transfer**: The platform enables rapid deployment of expert knowledge across large organizations, allowing companies to scale expert-level performance without requiring extensive traditional training programs.

**AI-Ready Knowledge Formalization**: The extracted knowledge is structured in formats that can be directly integrated into AI systems, enabling the development of automated decision-making tools that operate with expert-level understanding.

**Domain Adaptability**: While initially focused on security incident response and call center operations, the technology's architecture is designed to adapt to various professional domains where expert knowledge transfer is critical.

**Quality Assurance Mechanisms**: Built-in validation systems ensure that the captured knowledge maintains accuracy and relevance, with continuous monitoring and feedback loops that identify and correct any degradation in knowledge quality over time.

## BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND USE CASES

**Security Incident Response**: In cybersecurity operations, the ability to capture and transfer expert incident response knowledge is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience. NTT's technology enables security teams to formalize the decision-making processes of senior analysts, allowing junior staff to handle complex incidents with expert-level guidance. This capability is particularly valuable in 24/7 security operations centers where expert availability may be limited.

**Call Center Operations**: Customer service environments benefit significantly from this technology's ability to capture expert customer interaction knowledge. By analyzing conversations between expert agents and challenging customers, the system can create guidance frameworks that help newer agents provide consistent, high-quality service. This application directly addresses the common challenge of maintaining service quality while managing workforce turnover and training costs.

**Technical Support and Troubleshooting**: Complex technical environments often rely on a small number of experts who understand intricate system interactions and troubleshooting processes. The Expert Knowledge Visualization AI can capture this expertise and make it available through automated systems or guided interfaces, reducing dependency on individual experts and improving response times.

**Training and Development**: Organizations can use the technology to create comprehensive training programs based on actual expert performance rather than theoretical knowledge. This approach ensures that training reflects real-world decision-making scenarios and provides learners with practical, applicable skills.

**AI System Enhancement**: The formalized expert knowledge serves as high-quality training data for AI systems, enabling the development of automated tools that can handle routine queries and decisions with expert-level understanding. This application creates opportunities for human experts to focus on more complex, strategic work while AI handles standard operations.

**Knowledge Preservation**: As expert employees retire or change roles, organizations often lose critical institutional knowledge. This technology provides a systematic approach to capturing and preserving expert knowledge, ensuring organizational continuity and reducing the risk associated with knowledge loss.
